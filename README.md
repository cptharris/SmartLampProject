# SmartLampProject

### A Guided Project with UCSB IEEE

Started by getting the LED strip set up and working nicely

Fixed the range finder code so that LEDs only come on when rangefinder is activated

Error! once range finder reads less than 100 cm, the light scene goes through whatever it wants to do, but rangefinder is NOT BEING READ. it has to wait for the LED scene to complete. how to fix this?
